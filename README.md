#### Who are Dr. Strangely Strange?
###### Dr. Strangely Strange are a psychedelic folk band from Ireland. They have a cult following but no official website. The members use a Facebook page for news and archival material. 

#### Why Bootstrap 4?
###### I used Bootstrap 4 in order to create a website using the latest version of Bootstrap. I wanted to challenge myself to make a website that was both future proofed and also challenging to make, due to fewer available resources online.

#### Josh

Josh is 22 years old and recently found out about Dr. Strangely Strange during Record Store Day. He went to his local record store in Seattle and came across a special reissue of their Heavy Petting album. Josh is interested in this type of music and is hoping that by doing some research on this band he will discover other bands from that era along with viewing their other records. Like most young people, Ben has no issues navigating websites however he often surfs the web on his phone, so website should be optimised.

#### Brian
Brian is 70 years old and remembers going to see Doctor Strangely Strange as a young student. He’s interested in viewing archival photos and videos of the band, and perhaps contacting them to see if they would be interested in some of the materials he has. Brian is media savvy, but quite impatient with load times and navigation. Things have to be succinct and easy, otherwise he’ll get frustrated and stop navigating.

#### Tessa
Tessa is 47 years old and runs a gallery in London. She came across the band through the work of writer Ian Sinclair, who made a documentary on the band in the 1960’s. She wants to see if the band would perform in her venue, but she’s not sure if they are still going. She’s interested in listening to Dr. Strangely Strange’s music for the first time, seeing have they played recently and getting in contact with them. She’s also looking to see if there are any nice photos she can use for promoting the show, if it goes forward. She doesn’t have a lot of time and needs to get the band confirmed as soon as possible.
